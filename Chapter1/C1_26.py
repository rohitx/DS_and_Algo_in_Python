'''
C-1.26: Write a short program that takes as input three integers a, b, and c
from the console and determines if they can be used in a correct arithmetic
formula in the given order, like "a+b = c", "a=b-c", a*b = c

#Pseudo-code:

This is fairly straightforward so I will write just a pseudo code
for this one.
Use input() function to take user input.
Check to see there are three values
Use the if statement to check each arithmetic formula condition
if all three work, return as true else return false.
