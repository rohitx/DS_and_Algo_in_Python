R-2.2: Give an example of a software application in which adaptability can
mean the difference between a prolonged lifetime of sales and bankruptcy.

Answer: Consider the personal finance software called YNAB. The software
exists on the desktops and as application on smartphones. The primary
function of YNAB is to manage personal finance. It does this with the user
setting aside a budget for every thing in one's life such as rent, groceries,
travel, etc. The user then inputs transactions through the month on various
things. If the application only existed for desktops, user would have to sit
every day and type of the information in the deskop application. However, by
adapting the application to smartphones, the company has made it easier to
input various transactions immediately, thus making it convenient to the user
and improving the sales of their product.
