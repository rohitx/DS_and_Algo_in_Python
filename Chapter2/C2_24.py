C-2.24: Suppose you are on the design team for a new e-book reader. What are
the primary classes and methods that the Python software for your reader will
need? You should include an inheritance diagram for this code, but you do not
need to write any actual code. Your software architecture should at least
include ways for customers to buy new books, view their list of purchased books,
and read their purchased books.

#Pseudo-code

Let's make UML diagram:

------------------------------
|Class:  eBookReader         |
------------------------------
|Fields:         |
|                |
|                |
------------------------------
|Methods: get_flowerName()   |
|         set_flowerName()   |
|         get_petalNumber()  |
|         set_petal_Number   |
|         get_price()        |
|         set_price()        |
------------------------------
